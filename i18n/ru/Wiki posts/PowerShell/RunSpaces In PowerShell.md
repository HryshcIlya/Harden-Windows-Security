# RunSpaces In PowerShell

The concept of Runspaces is built upon the .NET threading model, which allows PowerShell to execute multiple scripts or commands in parallel. This is achieved by creating separate instances of the PowerShell engine, each running in its own thread, thus not interfering with the primary PowerShell session or other Runspaces.

Utilizing Runspaces effectively requires an understanding of threading and synchronization, as data sharing between threads must be handled carefully to avoid race conditions and ensure thread safety. The [synchronized hashtable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.hashtable.synchronized), as demonstrated in the provided script, is a prime example of a thread-safe data structure that facilitates communication between Runspaces.

## How To Create RunSpace and PowerShell Instance and Reuse Them

```powershell
# Display the number of the runspaces before operation
(Get-Runspace).count

# Create a synchronized hashtable for inter-runspace communication
$SyncHash = [System.Collections.Hashtable]::Synchronized(@{})

# Create a new runspace
$GUIRunSpace = [System.Management.Automation.RunSpaces.RunSpaceFactory]::CreateRunSpace()
$GUIRunSpace.ApartmentState = 'STA'
$GUIRunSpace.ThreadOptions = 'ReuseThread'

# Create a new PowerShell object
$GUIPowerShell = [System.Management.Automation.PowerShell]::Create()
# Assign the runspace to the PowerShell object's Runspace property
$GUIPowerShell.RunSpace = $GUIRunSpace
# Open the runspace
$GUIRunSpace.Open()

# Make the synchronized hashtable available in the runspace
$GUIRunSpace.SessionStateProxy.SetVariable('SyncHash', $SyncHash)

# Add a script to the PowerShell object so that it can run inside the runspace
[System.Void]$GUIPowerShell.AddScript({
        Write-Output -InputObject '1st output'
    })

# Invoke the PowerShell object asynchronously and store the resulting handle in a variable
$GUIAsyncObject = $GUIPowerShell.BeginInvoke()

# End the asynchronous operation and display the output
$GUIPowerShell.EndInvoke($GUIAsyncObject)

# Add another script to the PowerShell object to run, replacing the previous script added to the object.
# The runspace is still open
[System.Void]$GUIPowerShell.AddScript({
        Write-Output -InputObject '2nd output'
    })

# Again invoke the PowerShell object asynchronously and store the resulting handle in a variable
$GUIAsyncObject = $GUIPowerShell.BeginInvoke()

# End the asynchronous operation and display the output
$GUIPowerShell.EndInvoke($GUIAsyncObject)

# Close and dispose of the runspace and PowerShell object
$GUIPowerShell.Dispose()
$GUIRunSpace.Close()
$GUIRunSpace.Dispose()

# Display the number of the runspaces after operation
(Get-Runspace).count
```

## How To Handle RunSpace Events Asynchronously From The Parent RunSpace

This example demonstrates how to create a runspace that runs a GUI thread asynchronously and based on the events happening in the GUI thread, different actions are taken in the parent thread. The parent thread is responsible for handling the events generated by the GUI thread, such as button clicks, window closures, and errors. At the end of the operation, the runspace is closed and disposed of, ensuring no leftover runspaces or jobs.
